## Hej ðŸ‘‹

This organization holds the code base for the Smart POA Project.

We research how digital powers of attorney records can be designed and used in the real world, enabling participants with more security.

Currently we are a closed research project, but eventually want to open up gradually.

One of our goals is to publish a specification that aims to propose a standardized design for exchangable digital power of attorney records.

Feel free to contact us on Github or the provided contact mail address.
